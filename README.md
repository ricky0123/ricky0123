<h3 align="center">Projects you'll find here...</h3>

- [VAD](https://github.com/ricky0123/vad) - a popular JS package for performing voice activity detection in the browser, an essential component of speech-enabled websites. See it in action at [vad.ricky0123.com](https://www.vad.ricky0123.com/).
- [Vocoder](https://github.com/ricky0123/vocoder) - a Python package for dictation and speech-based input. The user writes a Python script that defines how patterns of speech map to Python functions to run, and these functions can leverage the Python ecosystem to simulate keystrokes or issue commands to applications. It is based on the academic work surrounding [kleenexlang](https://kleenexlang.org). It is undoubtedly my favorite piece of software that I've written!
- [Nomad cities](https://github.com/ricky0123/nomad-cities) - a [website](https://www.spikynomadball.ricky0123.com/) showing the most mentioned cities on [r/digitalnomad](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/) as estimated using a [Spacy named entity recognition model](https://spacy.io/models/en#en_core_web_lg) to determine cities mentioned in comments and querying [Geonames](https://www.geonames.org/) for the extracted text.
- [Algo](https://github.com/ricky0123/algo) - configure multi-level bash aliases through yaml. Written in Go.
- [Sleep sounds](https://github.com/ricky0123/sleep-sounds) - a stupidly simple [sleep noise site](https://www.sleep-sounds.ricky0123.com/) written using the web audio API and SolidJS.
