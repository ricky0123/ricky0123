<h3>Projects you'll find here...</h3>

- [ricky0123/vad-web](https://github.com/ricky0123/vad) - a JavaScript package that allows you to prompt users for microphone permissions and run callbacks on segments of audio with user speech in a few lines of code. Under the hood, it runs a voice activity detection model in the browser. Used by over 100 projects on GitHub.
- [Vocoder](https://github.com/ricky0123/vocoder) - a Python package for dictation and speech-based input. The user writes a Python script that defines how patterns of speech map to Python functions to run, and these functions can leverage the Python ecosystem to simulate keystrokes or issue commands to applications. It is based on the academic work surrounding [kleenexlang](https://kleenexlang.org). One of my favorite software projects that I have worked on :ok_hand:
- [Nomad cities](https://github.com/ricky0123/nomad-cities) - a [website](https://www.spikynomadball.ricky0123.com/) showing the most mentioned cities on [r/digitalnomad](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/) as estimated using a Spacy named entity recognition model to determine cities mentioned in comments and querying [Geonames](https://www.geonames.org/) for the extracted text.
- [Algo](https://github.com/ricky0123/algo) - configure multi-level bash aliases through yaml. Written in Go.
- [Sleep sounds](https://github.com/ricky0123/sleep-sounds) - a very simple [sleep noise site](https://www.sleep-sounds.ricky0123.com/) written using the web audio API and SolidJS.
